  <title>Kindness Equality Inclusion Diversity Peace Love Garden Flag Rainbow Inspirational House Banner by TheCharmedCardinal | The Charmed Cardinal</title>
  <meta name="description" content="Bright, lightweight garden and house banner that brings a gentle, inclusive message to your porch, garden, or entryway. Printed on both sides in vivid, rainbow-hued script that reads like a handwritten mantra — “Kindness, Equality, Inclusion, Diversity, Peace, Love.” The slim sleeve at the top slips onto standard garden flag poles or small stands so the banner hangs with a clean, vertical presence. The poplin-canvas fabric feels breezy in a summer wind and holds color well, while the subtle black inner lining prevents show-through for a crisp look from either side. Two sizes let you choose a small accent for a planter or a larger statement for a walkway or balcony.
Product features
- 100% poly poplin-canvas fabric — lightweight with fine warp and thicker weft for durability
- Vibrant, high-definition printing with bright, crisp colors
- Sleeve at top fits standard garden flagpoles or stands (pole/hooks not included)
- Printed on both sides with design flipped on long edge for vertical orientation
- Available in two sizes: 12&quot;×18&quot; and 24.5&quot;×32&quot;; black inner lining to reduce show-through
Care instructions
- Clean by wiping with a soft, damp cloth." />
