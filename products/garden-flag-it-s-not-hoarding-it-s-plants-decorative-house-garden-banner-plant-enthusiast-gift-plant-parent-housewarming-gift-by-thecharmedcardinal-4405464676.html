  <title>Garden Flag &quot;It&#39;s Not Hoarding, It&#39;s Plants&quot; Decorative House &amp; Garden Banner, Plant Enthusiast Gift, Plant Parent, Housewarming Gift by TheCharmedCardinal | The Charmed Cardinal</title>
  <meta name="description" content="A charming garden and house banner that brings soft, indoor-jungle energy to porches, patios, and windowsills. The design features a row of potted houseplants in warm, muted tones with the playful script “It’s Not Hoarding If it’s Plants,” creating a cozy, slightly cheeky statement for fellow plant lovers. Printed on both sides so the artwork reads clearly from either angle, the banner’s lightweight poly poplin-canvas keeps colors bright while remaining easy to hang. Slip it onto a standard garden flag pole or display stand and watch it add personality to entryways, garden paths, or sunlit nooks where plant collections live and grow. Original and hand drawn without the use of AI.
