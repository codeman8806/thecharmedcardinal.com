Carry a little indoor jungle wherever you go. This sturdy tote features a row of hand-drawn potted houseplants across a crisp white canvas, giving a fresh, calming pop to your daily errands or weekend market runs. The medium-weight polyester keeps the print vibrant and the bag holding its shape, while boxed corners add roomy depth for groceries, books, or plant-shop finds. Reinforced handle stitching and a non-woven laminate interior mean this bag stands up to repeated use — like a reliable companion for plant lovers who move between city apartments, community gardens, and cozy living rooms. The playful pot colors and varied foliage bring a quiet, green energy that fits into plant-swap meetups, weekend nurseries, or simply brightening a commute.
