Crunchy coconut coir fibers welcome guests with a warm, homey smile. This outdoor doormat brings a touch of vintage holiday charm—softly weathered text and a retro ornament motif—while standing up to muddy shoes and wet boots. Slide it in front of a porch light or tuck it under an awning; the dense Grade-A tufted coir scrapes dirt and traps debris, and the black vinyl anti-slip backing keeps the mat steady on stoops, steps, and entryways. Assembled in the USA from globally sourced parts, it’s a simple way to set a cozy seasonal tone every time the door opens.
Product features
- Grade-A tufted coconut coir for effective scraping and natural durability
- Black vinyl anti-slip backing keeps the mat securely in place
- Sized 24&quot; × 16&quot; (61cm x 40.6cm) — fits most standard doorways
- Designed mainly for outdoor use; resists moisture and wear
- Assembled in the USA using globally sourced components
Care instructions
- Place your mat in a covered, weather-protected area such as under an overhang, awning or portico. Do not expose to direct sunlight or excessive moisture. Because these mats are made with natural coir fibers, there may be some initial shedding over the first month of use, it can be easily removed by occasionally shaking the mat to get rid of the loose fibers.</p>
