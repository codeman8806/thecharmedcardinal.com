        <h1>5 ways to style your porch with garden flags</h1>
        <p class="section-intro">
          Garden flags are small, but they make a big impact. With the right
          design and placement, you can turn a simple front porch into a warm,
          welcoming space that shows off your personality.
        </p>

        <h2>1. Start with a flag that tells a story</h2>
        <p>
          Choose a garden flag that reflects something you love – plants, pets,
          or a message you want guests to see first. For plant parents, a
          playful “It’s Not Hoarding, It’s Plants” design is a fun way to greet
          visitors before they even step inside.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Layer in potted plants and textures</h2>
        <p>
          Place your flag stand near a cluster of potted plants or flowers. Mix
          different heights and textures: a tall plant, a trailing vine, and a
          textured doormat to frame the flag and draw the eye toward your front
          door.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Coordinate colors with your door and railing</h2>
        <p>
          Look at your front door color, railings, and any existing decor. Pick
          a flag with colors that complement what you already have – for
          example, blues and greens for a navy door, or warm reds and golds for
          a wood-stained entryway.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Swap designs with the seasons</h2>
        <p>
          Keep a small rotation of flags on hand so you can update your porch
          with the seasons. A “Leave the Leaves” eco-friendly design for fall,
          a snowflake mandala for winter, and a bright nature scene for spring
          keeps your space feeling fresh all year.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Tie everything together with lighting</h2>
        <p>
          Soft lighting makes your flag and plants stand out at night. Try
          solar stake lights along your walkway or a string of warm white lights
          on the railing. The gentle glow around your flag creates a cozy,
          welcoming look after sunset.
        </p>
